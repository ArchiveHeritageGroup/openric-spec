# Fixture: `agent-person-simple`

A single Agent response (in this case resolved as `rico:Agent` because the underlying actor has no `entity_type_id`). Exercises: `@context` prefix bindings, `@id` / `@type` / `name` minimal Agent payload, schema selection by `@type`, SHACL `AgentShape` with `rico:name` shorthand.

**Profile:** `authority-context` · **Status:** done

**Source:** [`https://heratio.theahg.co.za/api/ric/v1/agents/d6mh-ktzy-h6qz`](https://heratio.theahg.co.za/api/ric/v1/agents/d6mh-ktzy-h6qz)

**Validation:** [`expected.jsonld`](./expected.jsonld) MUST validate against the schema selected by its `@type`.
